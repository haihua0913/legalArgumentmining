Co_Training_2C
# Co-training algorithm with 2 classifiers which are Random Forest and LightGBM.

Input: Labeled and Unlabeled data
Output: A classier that takes an unlabeled document and predicts a class label

Steps to run the code:

Step1: Upload all the labeled, unlabeled and test data into the google drive and mention the path of the files to the respective variables in the code.
Step2: All the results are written into a text file. Mention the path of the file names.

# Legal_Text_Classification

Train data creation:
    Labeled Data : Create a folder with name Labeled and copy the 11 train datasets into it.
    Unlabled Data : Create a folder with name Unlabeled and copy the unlabeled data into it.
    Test Data: Create a folder with name Test and copy the test data into it.


Co_Training_2C

# Co-training algorithm with 2 classifiers which are Random Forest and LightGBM.

Input: Labeled and Unlabeled data
Output: A classier that takes an unlabeled document and predicts a class label

Steps to run the code:

    Step1: Upload all the labeled, unlabeled and test data into the google drive and mention the path of the files to the respective variables in the code.
    Step2: All the results are written into a text file. Mention the path of the file names.
    Step3: Run all the cells in the notebook.

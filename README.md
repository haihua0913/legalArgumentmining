# Legal_Argument_Mining

Train data creation:

    Labeled Data : Create a folder with name Labeled and copy the 11 train datasets into it.
    Unlabled Data : Create a folder with name Unlabeled and copy the unlabeled data into it.
    Test Data: Create a folder with name Test and copy the test data into it.


Co_Training_2C

# Co-training algorithm with 2 classifiers which are Random Forest and LightGBM.

Input: Labeled and Unlabeled data
Output: A classier that takes an unlabeled document and predicts a class label

Steps to run the code:

    Step1: Upload all the labeled, unlabeled and test data into the google drive and mention the path of the files to the respective variables in the code.
    Step2: All the results are written into a text file. Mention the path of the file names.
    Step3: Run all the cells in the notebook.

Co_Training_3C

# Co-training algorithm with 3 classifiers which are Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and LightGBM.

Input: Labeled and Unlabeled data
Output: A classier that takes an unlabeled document and predicts a class label

Steps to run the code:

    Step1: Upload all the labeled, unlabeled and test data into the google drive and mention the path of the files to the respective variables in the code.
    Step2: All the results are written into a text file. Mention the path of the file names.
    Step3: Run all the cells in the notebook.

# EM_03_Modular_UL Expectation Maximization

Input : Labeled and Unlabeled data
Output: A best model that can predict the class labels of unlabeled data.

Steps to run the code:

    Step1: Upload all the labeled, unlabeled and test data into the google drive and mention the path of the files to the respective variables in the code.
    Step2: All the results are written into a text file. Mention the path of the file names.
    Step3: Run all the cells in the notebook.

# PseudoLabeling with LighGBM

    Step1: Upload all the labeled, unlabeled and test data into the google drive and mention the path of the files to the respective variables in the code.
    Step2: All the results are written into a text file. Mention the path of the file names.
    Step3: Change the variables 'Threshold' and 'unlabel_size_list' accoding to the experiment.
    Step4: Run all the cells in the notebook.

# Supervised Learning

    All the codes that are related to supervised Learning can be run using the below steps.
    Step1: Upload all the labeled and test data into the google drive and mention the path of the files to the respective variables in the code.
    Step2: Run all the cells in the notebook.
    
    For Supervised_allData
    
    Comment and uncomment the classifiers according to the experiment.
    For example: If you need to run the LightGBM, uncomment the LightGBM classifier and comment the all the other classifiers.
